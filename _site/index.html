<h1>Calendar of Events</h1>
<p>The club activities are member created, and lead by those that volunteer to be the event leader and can be found on our Google Calendar page. You must have a Google login to view the events and activities calendar.</p>
<p>We schedule events throughout the year and enjoy hiking, backpacking, kayaking, bicycle riding, and in the wintertime snowshoeing, and cross-country skiing in the Erie region and beyond.</p>
<p>Whether you’re a seasoned outdoor enthusiast or just starting out, we welcome you to join us on our activities. Members initiate events, which they lead. These activities are posted on our Google calendar.</p>
<p>We’re a friendly and supportive group, and we enjoy sharing our love of the outdoors with others. So come join us for outdoor adventures. Members and first time guests should reach out to the event coordinator in advance of the event if you are going to be participating and attending.</p>
